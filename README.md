# Flight Booker

This is a solution to the [Flight Booker](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker) project from the [Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Rails path. 

## Features

A nested form that makes use of #accepts_nested_attributes_for that creates all of the passengers associated with a booking at once. 

### Update

Form now uses Stimulus to allow adding and removing of passenger fields from booking form in case user changes their mind about how many tickets they would like.
